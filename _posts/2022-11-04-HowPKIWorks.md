## Introduction

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a comprehensive framework designed to manage digital certificates and public-key encryption. It facilitates secure communication and authentication over networks, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity.

### 1. Understanding PKI Architecture

#### 1.1 What is PKI?

PKI is a system of hardware, software, policies, and standards that manage the creation, distribution, and revocation of digital certificates. These certificates are used to verify the identity of users, devices, and services.

#### 1.2 Components of PKI

PKI is composed of several integral components that work together to provide a secure environment for digital communications:

- **Certificate Authority (CA**): The Certificate Authority (CA) is the cornerstone of PKI. It is a trusted entity responsible for issuing, revoking, and managing digital certificates. The CA verifies the identity of entities requesting certificates and signs them with its private key, ensuring their authenticity.

- **Registration Authority (RA)**: The Registration Authority (RA) acts as an intermediary between the CA and the entities requesting certificates. It handles the initial verification of the entities' identities before forwarding their requests to the CA for approval and issuance.

- **Certificate Database**: The Certificate Database is a centralized repository that stores all issued certificates and their associated metadata. This database is crucial for managing the lifecycle of certificates, including tracking their validity, renewal, and revocation status.

- **Certificate Store**: The Certificate Store is a secure repository where certificates and their private keys are stored. It ensures that certificates are readily accessible for applications and systems to use in secure communication and authentication processes.

- **Key Management System** : The Key Management System is responsible for the secure handling of cryptographic keys. It manages the creation, distribution, storage, and destruction of keys, ensuring that they are protected throughout their lifecycle. This system is vital for maintaining the security and integrity of the PKI infrastructure.

The diagram below shows the relation between these components

#### 1.3 Types of PKI Architectures

PKI architectures can be broadly categorized into two types:

- **Publicly Trusted PKI**: Publicly Trusted PKI is used for public-facing services and relies on certificates issued by trusted CAs. These certificates are recognized and trusted by clients and operating systems in public channels, such as the internet.

- **Privately Trusted PKI**: Privately Trusted PKI is used within organizations to secure internal assets and networks. It involves running a private CA that issues certificates for internal use, providing control over the PKI infrastructure.
