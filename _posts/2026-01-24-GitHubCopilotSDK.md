## Introduction

GitHub Copilot SDK is a recently launched SDK that helps you build AI Agents faster and in a more reliable way. It abstracts away most of the common boilerplate code required for building AI agents, allowing developers to focus on creating unique and innovative agent capabilities.

>The feature is still in preview and expected to change over time. For the latest updates, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk).

## Purpose

The GitHub Copilot SDK is a new framework that allows developers to embed Copilot‑like agentic capabilities directly into any application—not just IDEs. It represents a major evolution from traditional “autocomplete AI” toward full agentic coding workflows, where AI systems can plan, execute, and manage complex multi-step software development tasks.
