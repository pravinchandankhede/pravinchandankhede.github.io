## What are Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems capable of sensing, learning and acting upon their environments(both digital & physical) to achieve specific objectives.

## What are AI Agents?

AI Agent is an software that leverages the Generative AI capabilities to perform complex task and exhibit an human like behaviour. These agents are self driven and can adjust thier behavior based on environmental and data parameters. These agents do not need constant human intervention and can work continusly round the clock just like any other software.

## Types of AI Agents

## Brain of an Agent

## Memory of an Agent

Agents have evolved from simple software agents to more complex AI Agents. AI Agents are more intelligent and can take decisions based on the environment they are in. They can also learn from the environment and improve their decision making capabilities.

## Conclusion

We saw the evolution of AI Agents and how they have evolved from simple bots to more complex AI Agents. We also saw the characteristics of AI Agents and the core components of AI Agents. We also saw the categories and types of AI Agents. We also saw the patterns of AI Agents that can be used to solve common problems. AI Agents are the future of AI and will play a key role in solving complex problems.
