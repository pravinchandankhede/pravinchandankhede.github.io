# What are Agents?
AI agents are autonomous systems capable of sensing, learning and acting upon their environments(both digital & physical) to achieve specific objectives.

## Evolution of Agents
Agents have evolved from simple software agents to more complex AI Agents. AI Agents are more intelligent and can take decisions based on the environment they are in. They can also learn from the environment and improve their decision making capabilities.

 - **Simple LLM Bots:** With the era of Gen AI, we had a new breed of bots coming in that can understand the semantic meaning of user query and provide data using a pre-trained LLM model. The response was more like humans and gives the feeling of a human like conversation. These bots were trained on large data set and could often provide information on a wide range of topics.

 - **RAG bases Bots:** While the LLM bots were capable of understanding the semantic meaning of the user query, and giving the generalized answers, they were not capable of using your own data and formulating responses based on facts that you provide. This is where we see RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation) based bots came into picture. These bots can understand the semantic meaning of the user query and can also use your own data to provide responses. They can also use the pre-trained LLM models to provide generalized answers. This is where Enterprises found value in Gen AI and utlized this technology to increase value of their services.

 - **Copilots:** Copilots are the next generation of bots which works under the context of a user current work and is natively integrated with the application being used. This enables user to take advantage of LLM without leaving the context and helps in continuity of flow. These bots understand the intent of user and compliments the ability of user to perform the task. Together with RAG capability, they can further improve the user experience and provide more value to the user.
  
   Examples of such bots are: Microsoft Copilot, GitHub Copilot, etc.

- **AI Agents:** AI Agents are the most advanced form of bots which can understand the environment they are in, act on their own based on the environment feedback and change in operational parameters. They can talk to other agents and collaborate with them to achieve a common goal. They can use different LLMs to infer and act like humans. They can use different AI models to learn and improve their decision making capabilities. They can utilize the tools to take tangible actions based on the environment feedback.

  AI Agents are the topic of this article and we will see how they are different from other bots and how they can be used to solve complex problems.

## Characteristics of AI Agents
AI Agents have the following characteristics:
- An AI agent responds autonomously.
- They understand the environment they are in.
- They act on their own based on the environment feedback and change in operational parameters.
- Talk to other agents and collaborate with them to achieve a common goal.
- Use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
- Use different AI models to learn and improve their decision making capabilities.
- Utilize the tools to take tangible actions based on the environment feedback.

## Core Components of AI Agents
AI Agents have the following core components:

- **Sensors**: Sensors are used to sense the environment and collect data.
- **Actuators**: Actuators are used to act on the environment based on the data collected by the sensors.

## Challenges with AI Agents
AI Agents have the following challenges
- They are 
## What is Agentic AI
Agentic AI is the new way of organizing your agents and making them more intelligent, human friendly and self sustainable.

## What is Semantic Kernel
Semantic Kernel is an SDK by Microsoft which helps us to write AI Agents. These AI Agents are highly collaborative and can use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
