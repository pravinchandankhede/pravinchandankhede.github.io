# What are Agents?
AI agents are autonomous systems capable of sensing, learning and acting upon their environments(both digital & physical) to achieve specific objectives.

## Evolution of Agents
Agents have evolved from simple software agents to more complex AI Agents. AI Agents are more intelligent and can take decisions based on the environment they are in. They can also learn from the environment and improve their decision making capabilities.

## Characteristics of AI Agents
AI Agents have the following characteristics:
- An AI agent responds autonomously.
- They understand the environment they are in.
- They act on their own based on the environment feedback and change in operational parameters.
- Talk to other agents and collaborate with them to achieve a common goal.
- Use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
- Use different AI models to learn and improve their decision making capabilities.
- Utilize the tools to take tangible actions based on the environment feedback.

## Core Components of AI Agents
AI Agents have the following core components:

- **Sensors**: Sensors are used to sense the environment and collect data.
- **Actuators**: Actuators are used to act on the environment based on the data collected by the sensors.

## Challenges with AI Agents
AI Agents have the following challenges
- They are 
## What is Agentic AI
Agentic AI is the new way of organizing your agents and making them more intelligent, human friendly and self sustainable.

## What is Semantic Kernel
Semantic Kernel is an SDK by Microsoft which helps us to write AI Agents. These AI Agents are highly collaborative and can use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
