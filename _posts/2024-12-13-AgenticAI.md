# What are Agents?
AI agents are autonomous systems capable of sensing, learning and acting upon their environments(both digital & physical) to achieve specific objectives.

## Evolution of Agents
Agents have evolved from simple software agents to more complex AI Agents. AI Agents are more intelligent and can take decisions based on the environment they are in. They can also learn from the environment and improve their decision making capabilities.

 - **Simple LLM Bots:** With the era of Gen AI, we had a new breed of bots coming in that can understand the semantic meaning of user query and provide data using a pre-trained LLM model. The response was more like humans and gives the feeling of a human like conversation. These bots were trained on large data set and could often provide information on a wide range of topics.

 - **RAG bases Bots:** While the LLM bots were capable of understanding the semantic meaning of the user query, and giving the generalized answers, they were not capable of using your own data and formulating responses based on facts that you provide. This is where we see RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation) based bots came into picture. These bots can understand the semantic meaning of the user query and can also use your own data to provide responses. They can also use the pre-trained LLM models to provide generalized answers. This is where Enterprises found value in Gen AI and utlized this technology to increase value of their services.

 - **Copilots:** Copilots are the next generation of bots which works under the context of a user current work and is natively integrated with the application being used. This enables user to take advantage of LLM without leaving the context and helps in continuity of flow. These bots understand the intent of user and compliments the ability of user to perform the task. Together with RAG capability, they can further improve the user experience and provide more value to the user.
  
   Examples of such bots are: Microsoft Copilot, GitHub Copilot, etc.

- **AI Agents:** AI Agents are the most advanced form of bots which can understand the environment they are in, act on their own based on the environment feedback and change in operational parameters. They can talk to other agents and collaborate with them to achieve a common goal. They can use different LLMs to infer and act like humans. They can use different AI models to learn and improve their decision making capabilities. They can utilize the tools to take tangible actions based on the environment feedback.

  AI Agents are the topic of this article and we will see how they are different from other bots and how they can be used to solve complex problems.

## Characteristics of AI Agents
AI Agents have the following characteristics:
- An AI agent responds autonomously.
- They understand the environment they are in.
- They act on their own based on the environment feedback and change in operational parameters.
- Talk to other agents and collaborate with them to achieve a common goal.
- Use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
- Use different AI models to learn and improve their decision making capabilities.
- Utilize the tools to take tangible actions based on the environment feedback.

## Core Components of AI Agents
AI Agents have the following core components:

![Core Components of AI Agent](/assets/images/posts/2024-12-13/agentcore.png)

- **User Input**: The user input is the trigger for most of the flows that a agent will start processing. This can be in the form of text, voice, image, etc. This can also be a automated trigger based on some event or data like a sensor sendign data to agent.
- **Environment**: The environment is the context in which the agent is operating. This can be a digital environment like a website, application, etc. or a physical environment like a factory, warehouse, etc. This serves as aboudnary of operation for agent.
- **Sensors**: Sensors are used to sense the environment and collect data. This is how a agent perceives the environment and understands the context in which it is operating. This can application, systems or pieces of hardware that are used to collect data.
- **Control Centre**: The control centre is the brain of the agent. It processes the data collected by the sensors and takes decisions based on the environment feedback and change in operational parameters. This is where the AI models are used to infer and act like humans.
- **Effectors**: Effectors are the tools that are used to act on the environment based on the data collected by the sensors. This can be in the form of sending a message, updating a record, etc. These are also referred to as skills of an agent which means the capability of agent to perform a task.
- **Percepts**: Percepts are the data that is collected by the sensors. This can be in the form of signals, logs, events, data from other agents, etc. This is how the agent perceives the environment and let agent decides if it should take proactive action.
- **Actions**: Actions are the decisions taken by the agent based on the data collected by the sensors. This can be in the form of sending a message, updating a record, etc. This is how the agent acts on the environment based on the data collected by the sensors.
- **Learning**: Learning is the process of improving the decision making capabilities of the agent. This can be in the form of using different AI models to learn and improve the decision making capabilities. This can also be in the form of using different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
- **Memory**: Memory is the data that is stored by the agent. Memory enables the agent to remember the past events and uses them to take decisions in the future.

## Challenges with AI Agents
AI Agents have the following challenges
- They are 
## What is Agentic AI
Agentic AI is the new way of organizing your agents and making them more intelligent, human friendly and self sustainable.

## What is Semantic Kernel
Semantic Kernel is an SDK by Microsoft which helps us to write AI Agents. These AI Agents are highly collaborative and can use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
