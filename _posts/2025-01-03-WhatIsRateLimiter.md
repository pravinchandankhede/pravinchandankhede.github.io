# API Driven Development
API Driven Development is a software development approach that focuses on creating APIs first before developing the user interface. This approach is gaining popularity because it allows developers to build applications that are more flexible, scalable, and maintainable.
In API Based, the API is the core of the application, and the user interface is just one of the many ways to interact with the API. This approach allows developers to build applications that can be accessed from multiple devices and platforms, such as web browsers, mobile apps, and IoT devices.
API Driven Development is also known as API First Development, API Centric Development, and API Driven Design.

As the name implies, in API driven development, the process starts with identifying the APIs that will be needed to build the application. Once the APIs are defined in the form of Contract. Developers can start building the API endpoints and the data models that follows the contract and Testing team can write the test cases based on the contract.

## What are APIs?
APIs are the set of functionality expose to the consumption layer.
