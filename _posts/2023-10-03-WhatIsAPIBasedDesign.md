# API Driven Development
API Driven Development is a software development approach that focuses on creating APIs first before developing the user interface. This approach is gaining popularity because it allows developers to build applications that are more flexible, scalable, and maintainable.
In API Based, the API is the core of the application, and the user interface is just one of the many ways to interact with the API. This approach allows developers to build applications that can be accessed from multiple devices and platforms, such as web browsers, mobile apps, and IoT devices.
API Driven Development is also known as API First Development, API Centric Development, and API Driven Design.

As the name implies, in API driven development, the process starts with identifying the APIs that will be needed to build the application. Once the APIs are defined in the form of Contract. Developers can start building the API endpoints and the data models that follows the contract and Testing team can write the test cases based on the contract.

## What are APIs?
**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. These are called contracts and help connect both producer and consumers of APIs. The API contract is a binding to which both parties agree to adhere to.
APIs enable developers to integrate third-party services, access data, and extend the functionality of their applications without having to build everything from scratch.

## API Economy
The API Economy refers to the ecosystem of business models, strategies, and practices built around the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to create value-added products and services. It lets business create opportunities by monetizing their APIs by offering them as products or services, enabling other businesses to build on top of their platforms. This fosters innovation, accelerates development, and creates new revenue streams. 

For example, payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal provide APIs that allow businesses to integrate payment processing into their applications seamlessly.
 

### Key Aspects of the API Economy
- **Innovation and Efficiency**: APIs allow businesses to innovate rapidly by leveraging existing technologies and data. This reduces development time and costs, enabling faster time-to-market for new products and services.

- **Monetization Opportunities**: Companies can monetize their APIs by offering them as products or services. For example, payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal provide APIs that businesses can integrate into their applications to process payments.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: APIs provide scalability by allowing businesses to extend their services to a broader audience. They also offer flexibility by enabling developers to build custom solutions tailored to specific needs.

- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: By integrating APIs, businesses can offer a more seamless and personalized customer experience. For instance, travel booking platforms use APIs to aggregate data from various airlines and hotels, providing users with comprehensive options2.

### Examples of API Economy
 - **Cloud Services**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a vast collection of APIs that provide access to its infrastructure and application resources, enabling businesses to build and scale applications efficiently.
- **Communication Platforms**: Twilio provides APIs for messaging, voice, and video communication, allowing developers to integrate these functionalities into their applications.
- **Mapping Services**: Google Maps API allows developers to embed maps and location-based services into their applications, enhancing user experience.

### Challenges in the API Economy
While the API economy offers numerous advantages, it also presents challenges such as security risks, quality control issues, dependency on third-party APIs, and privacy concerns. Businesses must address these challenges to fully leverage the potential of APIs.

## Subscription-Based API Model
There are service providers where they expose functionalities and data to external applications and consumers. The service provider gives various plans that consumers can subscribe to based on their needs. The usgae of the API is monitored and charged based on the plan subscribed by the consumer. This gives flexibility amd power to consumers to utilise the service as per their needs without having to worry about the hassle of developing these services. 

This model is widely adopted across various industries, including software, entertainment, and e-commerce, due to its ability to generate predictable revenue and foster long-term customer relationships. This allows businesses to offer their core services to a broader audience. For instance, a weather service provider can offer an API that developers can use to fetch real-time weather data for their applications. This approach not only enhances the service provider's reach but also enables developers to create more feature-rich applications and in short duration of time.

### Key Components of a Subscription-Based API Model
- **Product Definition**: The product is the core offering of the subscription. It can be a digital service, software, or any other recurring service. The product details, such as name, description, and attributes, are defined in a product object within the API.

- **Pricing Structure**: The pricing model is crucial for a subscription-based API. It can be tiered pricing, where different levels of service are offered at different price points, or per-unit pricing, where charges are based on usage. The plan object in the API defines the pricing structure, billing cycles, and any discounts or promotions.

- **Payment Methods**: To cater to a global audience, subscription APIs support multiple payment methods, including credit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers. This ensures a seamless and consistent user experience across different regions.

- **Subscription Management**: The subscription object includes details about the start and end dates, billing cycles, and status of the subscription. It also provides controls for customers to manage their subscriptions, such as updating payment information, changing plans, or canceling the subscription.

Managed Services like [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management), [APIgee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee?hl=en) allow businesses to manage their APIs effectively by providing features such as API monitoring, analytics, security, and developer portals. These platforms help businesses streamline their API operations and enhance the developer experience. They are key enabler for businesses to offer subscription-based APIs.

### Benefits of Subscription-Based API Model
- **Predictable Revenue**: Recurring payments provide a steady and predictable revenue stream, which is beneficial for financial planning and growth.
- **Customer Retention**: Subscription models foster long-term relationships with customers, increasing retention and loyalty.
- **Scalability** : APIs allow businesses to scale their services easily by adding new features or expanding to new markets without significant infrastructure changes.

## Example of calling a HTTP Service in .NET 9
Below is an example of calling a HTTP service in .NET 9 using the HttpClient class. This code snippet demonstrates how to make a GET request to a REST API and deserialize the response into a C# object. The API shown here is a simple example, but the same approach can be used to call any REST API.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

/// <summary>
/// This is simple demo of how to make a GET request to a REST API using HttpClient.
/// </summary>
class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var apiUrl = "https://pcgitmfapi.azurewebsites.net/api/staff";
        var client = new HttpClient();

        try
        {
            // Make a GET request to the API
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(apiUrl);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

            // Read the response content
            var responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Response received from API:");
            Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Request error:");
            Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use HttpClient class to call a simple Staff API. This API returns a list of Staff members and doesn't need any token or key.
