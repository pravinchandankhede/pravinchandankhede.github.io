# What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieve, Answer and Generate. It is a pattern used in AI to generate responses to user queries. The RAG model is a powerful tool that can be used to generate responses to user queries by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, answering the query based on the retrieved information, and generating a response that is both informative and contextually relevant.
