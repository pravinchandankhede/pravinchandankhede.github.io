## 1. Introduction

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern software systems, enabling communication between different services and applications. They are now the defacto standards for system integration and extension.

The APIs are easily accessible over HTTP and a wide variety of devices, which makes them the first choice for developers. Many software vendors are exposing thier products through APIs. This makes their product

As APIs become more widely used, managing how they are accessed becomes critical ‚Äî and that's where **API rate limiting** comes in.

### What is API Rate Limiting?

**API rate limiting** is a technique used to control the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specified time frame. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that no single user or application can overwhelm the system with too many requests.

For example, an API might allow:

- 100 requests per minute per user
- 1,000 requests per day per IP address

These limits help maintain the stability, security, and performance of the API.

### Why is Rate Limiting Important?

Rate limiting serves several key purposes:

- ‚úÖ **Prevents Abuse**: Stops malicious users from spamming or launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Ensures Fair Usage**: Distributes resources evenly among users, preventing a few clients from monopolizing the API.
- üöÄ **Improves Performance**: Reduces server load and helps maintain consistent response times.
- üîê **Enhances Security**: Helps detect and block suspicious behavior patterns.
- üí∏ **Controls Costs**: Especially important for APIs with usage-based billing models.

In short, rate limiting is essential for building **scalable, secure, and reliable APIs**.
