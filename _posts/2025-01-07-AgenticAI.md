## What is Agentic AI
Agentic AI is the new way of organizing your agents and making them more intelligent, human friendly and self sustainable.

## What is Semantic Kernel
Semantic Kernel is an SDK by Microsoft which helps us to write AI Agents. These AI Agents are highly collaborative and can use different LLMs to infer and act like humans.
