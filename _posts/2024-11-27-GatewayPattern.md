# What is BFF API Gateway Pattern?
Today we are in era of application development where we are developing applications that are highly scalable, easy to user, responsive and performant. As applications are growing so is the choice for API driven systems. In this API driven development, most of the system are desinged around the collections of API which work together to provide a set of functionality or feature. This is frontended using a UI layer which helps user 'talk' to system.
There are many choices to develop this UI layer, however the most prominent one is to have single page application or SPA which are becoming defacto standards across industry.

These SPA apps are generally lazily loaded on the clinet browser and they often call API(s) to fetch the data and perform some actions.
