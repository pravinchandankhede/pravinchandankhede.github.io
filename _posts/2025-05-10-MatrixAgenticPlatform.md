## Conceptual Overview

Matrix is built around the concept of “agents”—autonomous, intelligent entities that perform tasks, interact with data, and deliver business value. The platform provides:

- **Agent Studio:** Tools for designing, developing, and managing agents.
- **Data Connectors:** Plug-and-play integration with databases, APIs, files, and more.
- **Knowledge Bases:** Support for multiple, dynamic knowledge repositories.
- **Model Integration:** Use any AI/ML model, switch or combine models as needed.
- **Declarative & Programmatic Development:** Build agents visually or with code.
